## 💡 What You'll Learn

This project includes **4 powerful AI agents** that analyze personal finance data:

1. **Spending Analyzer** - Breaks down spending by category
2. **Cash Flow Analyst** - Tracks money in vs. money out
3. **Budget Monitor** - Evaluates against the 50/30/20 rule
4. **Retirement Analyzer** - Analyzes 401(k)/403(b) performance

Each agent reads real financial documents (75 PDFs) and provides instant insights that would take hours manually.
